  <p>My name is Garry Fondevilla Glimada, married to Annabelle Ancheta Glimada on August 23, 2003 at Isla Parilla, Alabel, Glan, Sarangani. We moved in Beijing after our marriage. Our first child, Gen Abigail Ancheta Glimada, was born on December 29, 2004 by c-section at Peking Union Hospital, Beijing, China. She was born pre-term. Our second child, Gavin Gabriel Ancheta Glimada, was born on March 29, 2010 at General Santos Doctor's Hospital, General Santos City, Philippines.</p>

  <p>We lived in Beijing since 2003. We regularly take yearly vacation to visit our families back in the Philippines. Our childre grew up in Beijing and because of that, they cannot fluently speak nor understand Filipino language like Bisaya, Ilocano or Tagalog.</p>
  <p>My Family loves to:</p>

      <li>Go to church on Sundays</li>
  </ul>
